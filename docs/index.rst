Welcome to atlas-plot-utils!
============================

.. warning::
   ATLAS Plot Utils (formerly *ATLAS Plots*) is now mostly deprecated!

   Check out my new project, `ATLAS Plots <https://github.com/joeycarter/atlas-plots>`_, which uses `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_-like syntax and idioms to produce plots in ROOT following the standard ATLAS style guidelines.

----

**ATLAS Plot Utils** is a suite of utility functions and style settings for making pretty plots with `PyROOT <https://root.cern.ch/pyroot>`_ for the `ATLAS Experiment <https://atlas.cern/>`_ at `CERN <https://home.cern/>`_.

Writing code to produce high energy physics plots in classic C++ ROOT is notoriously cumbersome and slow.
PyROOT and **atlas-plot-utils** help make things a little easier.
